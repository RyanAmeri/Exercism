# Learnings for Complex Numbers

For some reason, I had actually never heard of complex numbers, though it seems a core component of Algebra in many middle/high schools? So first had to teach myself what they are, which was pretty easy. The only slightly tricky part was how to divide them, which requires finding the conjugate.

The other slightly trickly problem was converting the number to exponential form. I found the description rather confusing and had to search the web to find the formula to convert.

There really wasn't much _programming_ difficulty in this, it was just a matter of converting the maths formula to code.
