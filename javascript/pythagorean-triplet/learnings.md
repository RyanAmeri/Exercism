# Pythogorean Triplet learnings

I'm not sure I've learnt much new doing this exercise. It was rather simple, the only difficult part is to figure out the functionality of the where() static method. I eneded up using three nested loops, which is not really neat or performant but I couldn't thinkg of anything better. I then looked at the community solutions but they all seem to be using nested loops as well, so not sure if a better solution exists or not.
