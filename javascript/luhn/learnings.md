# Luhn Learnings
## Learning
There wasn't much new that I learnt here, but it was a good string manipulation exercise. 
## Refreshers
* Using Array.prototype.every()
* iterating through a string using the spread operator
* Replacing a charater inside a string using String.prototype.substr()
* Using Array.prototype.reduce()
* Good reminder that Strings in JS are immutable, they cannot be changed ala C. You need "string builder" functions
## Reflections after looking at community solutions
Some community solutions are pure functional programmin and are much more beautiful. The most starred solution by ceilfors is much more elegant. It constructs a class which has a property of "valid". And then uses various Array methods including map() to see set its value and returns it. This is much more elegant and readable.
