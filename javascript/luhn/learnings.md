# Luhn Learnings
## Learning
There wasn't much new that I learnt here, but it was a good string manipulation exercise. 
## Refreshers
* Using Array.prototype.every()
* iterating through a string using the spread operator
* Replacing a charater inside a string using String.prototype.substr()
* Using Array.prototype.reduce()
* Good reminder that Strings in JS are immutable, they cannot be changed ala C. You need "string builder" functions
