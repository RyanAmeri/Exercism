# Nucletoide Count

## Learnings
Spent a good amount of time on this exercise but I'm really happy with the end result. It allowed me to practice manipulating map objects, iterating through them, as well as practice RegExp and arry and string methods. 

I really struggled with getting the RegExp right. I think I finally have got it now though. Also I was getting a very strange bug in the tests where the G was being counted incorrectly. Turns out setting the values of the Map at initialisation is not very accurate, I solved the problem by explicitley setting the values to 0 during execution. 

## Future improvement 
The only thing I can think of to make this code better is to set the RegExp directly from Map keys. That way the code would be completely separated from the data.
