# Acronym Exercise Learnings

There was nothing new in this exercise but it was a good way to revisit some array and string methods. Specifically I got to practice

- Making a regex
- Using String.prototype.replace()
- Using String.prototype.split()
- Using Array.prototype.map()
- Using Array.prototype.join()
